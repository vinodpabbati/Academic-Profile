&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Polymeric </b> insulators are gaining more importance in power system as electrical insulation especially in high voltage applications with the reliability and their promising properties over traditional insulators made of porcelain, ceramic and glass. 
Compared to common organic polymers, silicone rubber insulators have higher heat resistance, chemical stability and providing better electrical insulation.
Silicone rubber insulators are being used in power transmission and distribution systems due to its inherent capabilities and advantages viz good pollution performance, lightweight, higher vandal resistance, higher hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity recovery. In recent times, it has become essential to design and develop, a compact, cost-effective and reliable insulation and the world over researchers are trying to use the advantages of nano-material to enhance further the silicone rubber material. Compared to base silicone rubber a small amount of filler addition can significantly improves the insulator properties. Selecting appropriate fillers with optimal concentration, shape and size of the particles can significantly improve the insulating properties of the base matrix.
